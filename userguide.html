<a NAME="Managing equipment"><font color="#373737"><h3>3. Managing equipment</font></h3></a>

<a NAME="The camera menu"><font color="#373737"><h4>3.1. The camera menu</font></h4></a>
<p>The camera selection menu is accessed in the program by clicking "Settings" -> "Camera" -> "Change camera". It will also show when you start the program if no default camera is chosen. If you check the "Use as default" box, the chosen camera will automatically be selected when you start the program in the future.</p>
<p>If your camera is not in the list of available cameras, you can add it by clicking the "Add new camera" button in the camera selection menu. Choose the camera type, input the camera name and pixel size, and click "OK" (if you don't know the pixel size, it shouldn't be hard to find by googling your camera). Your newly added camera can now be chosen from the list, which is sorted alphabetically. When you have added a new camera, all the tools except for the Image Analyser will initially be inaccessible, since they require sensor data like gain and read noise to function. How to get this data is described in this section: <a href="#Calculating sensor data">7.8. Calculating sensor data</a>.</p>

<a NAME="The telescope menu"><font color="#373737"><h4>3.2. The telescope menu</font></h4></a>
<p>The telescope selection menu lets you select your telescope or camera lens. Open it by clicking "Settings" -> "Telescope" -> "Change telescope". It works in exactly the same way as the camera selection menu.</p>
<p>If you want to add a new piece of optics, this works much the same as adding a new camera, except that you now have to provide the aperture diameter and focal length.</p>

<a NAME="Modifying camera or telescope parameters"><font color="#373737"><h4>3.3. Modifying camera or telescope parameters</font></h4></a>
<p>You can review and modify the sensor data for the currently active camera by selecting "Settings" -> "Camera" -> "Modify camera parameters". You will get a list where you can select any of the camera parameters. If the selected parameter contains multiple values (which will be the case if there is data for multiple ISO or gain values), there is also the option to select which ISO or gain you want to view the parameter value for. You can now change any parameter by inserting a new value and clicking "Set value". The program will be updated with the new parameter value. Note that this will reset the program and clear all the input boxes.</p>
<p>If you have added a new camera, you will notice that there is no value for quantum efficiency (QE). If you want to be able to get the skyglow and target flux quoted as luminances (mag/arcsec^2), you should add a value for the QE via the "Modify camera parameters" menu. What you want to add is the peak QE (for green light if the camera is a color camera), as a value between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to 100%.</p>
<p>The parameters for the selected piece of optics can be modified similarly to the camera parameters, by clicking "Settings" -> "Telescope" -> "Modify telescope parameters".</p>

<a NAME="Barlow lenses and focal reducers"><font color="#373737"><h4>3.4. Barlow lenses and focal reducers</font></h4></a>
<p>If you use a barlow lens or focal reducer in your imaging train, you can set the magnification value for this by selecting "Settings" -> "Change FL modifier".</p>

<br>
<a NAME="Navigation and interaction between tools"><font color="#373737"><h3>4. Navigation and interaction between tools</font></h3></a>

<a NAME="The tool menu"><font color="#373737"><h4>4.1. The tool menu</font></h4></a>
<p>This menu simply lets you navigate between the different tools. You will not lose data that you have added in a tool when changing to a different tool.</p>

<a NAME="Transferring data between tools"><font color="#373737"><h4>4.2. Transferring data between tools</font></h4></a>
<p>The Image Calculator, Image Simulator and Plotting Tool have buttons for transferring inputted values to other tools. When transferring data from the Image Calulator, you need to at least have calulated a value for skyglow before the data can be transferred, since the Image Simulator and Plotting Tool uses this in their input boxes rather than image data. When transferring inputted values between the Image Simulator and Plotting Tool, all the valid input will be copied directly over to their respective input box in the other tool. Transferring data from raw images in the Image Analyser to the Image Calulator is described this section: <a href="#Transferring data to the Image Calculator">7.7. Transferring data to the Image Calculator</a>.</p>

<a NAME="Clearing input"><font color="#373737"><h4>4.3. Clearing input</font></h4></a>
<p>All the tools have a button for clearing inputted data. If you click it, you will need to confirm the action before the data is cleared, to avoid that you remove the data by accident.</p>

<br>
<a NAME="The file menu"><font color="#373737"><h3>5. The file menu</font></h3></a>

<a NAME="Saving image data"><font color="#373737"><h4>5.1. Saving image data</font></h4></a>
<p>When you have calculated data from your image with the Image Calulator, you can save it so that it's easily accesible later. Click "File" -> "Save image data", and input a name for the saved data set, and click "Save". The data will be stored as comma separated values in a text file called "imagedata.txt".</p>

<a NAME="Loading image data"><font color="#373737"><h4>5.2. Loading image data</font></h4></a>
<p>You can load a previously saved set of calculated image data by clicking "File" -> "Load image data", and selecting a name from the list. You can load data to the input boxes of either the Image Calculator, Image Simulator or Plotting Tool. The correct values for the input boxes will be chosen depending on the tool you load the data to.</p>

<a NAME="Managing image data"><font color="#373737"><h4>5.3. Managing image data</font></h4></a>
<p>If you want to delete or rename a previously saved set of calculated image data, click "File" -> "Manage image data". Choose a name from the list, and choose whether you want to delete it or rename it. If you clicked "Rename", input a new name in the new window and click "Rename".</p>

<br>
<a NAME="More settings"><font color="#373737"><h3>6. More settings</font></h3></a>

<a NAME="Changing units"><font color="#373737"><h4>6.1. Changing units</font></h4></a>
<p>If the selected camera profile has a value for QE, you can choose between luminance and electron flux for the skyglow and target signal quantities. The luminance values are quoted in magnitudes per square arcsecond, and dependes less on the equipment than the electron flux (e-/s) values. They are therefore better suited for comparing sky and target conditions derived from images captured with different equipment. Note that the "magnitude" unit in question is somewhat dependent on the spectral sensitivity of the camera and will not generally correspond exactly to visual band magnitudes. Change the unit via the "Settings" -> "Signal quantity" menu.</p>
<p>You can also choose between stops and decibels for dynamic range by clicking "Settings" -> "Dynamic range unit". Finally you can get angular distances like field of view quoted in either degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds, or degrees only, by clicking "Settings" -> "Angle unit".</p>

<a NAME="Tooltips"><font color="#373737"><h4>6.2. Tooltips</font></h4></a>
<p>The tooltips that are displayed when you hover over a value or input widget in some of the tools can contain some useful information, but if you want you can disable them by clicking "Settings" -> "Tooltips" -> "Toggle tooltips". Here you can also choose whether you want them to disabled or enabled as default when you start the program.</p>

<a NAME="Changing font size"><font color="#373737"><h4>6.3. Changing font size</font></h4></a>
<p>The default font size is determined automatically based on your screen resolution. But you can select a font size manually by clicking "Settings" -> "Change font size" and choosing a size from the list. The new default font size will now be the one you selected. Note that changing the font size will restart the application, and all information in the input boxes will be lost.</p>

<a NAME="Reverting to original default values"><font color="#373737"><h4>6.4. Reverting to original default values</font></h4></a>
<p>When you check the "Set as default" box in the camera or telescope menu, your choice will be stored in the bottom of "cameradata.txt" or "telescopedata.txt" respectively. If you want the camera or telescope selection menu to show up every time you start the program, open the respective text file, scroll to the very bottom of the file and change the name after "Camera: " or "Telescope: " to "none". If you want the font size to be adjusted automatically based on screen resolution, change the number after "Fontsize: " to "auto" in "cameradata.txt".</p>

<br>
<a NAME="The Image Analyser"><font color="#373737"><h3>7. The Image Analyser</font></h3></a>

<p>The Image Analyser tool allows you to load raw images and extract information from them. The images that you add must be placed into one of five different categories: light, dark, bias, flat or saturated. The light frame is the actual image of your target. The bias, flat and saturated frames are used for calculating sensor data (see <a href="#Calculating sensor data">7.8. Calculating sensor data</a>), while the dark frames are for providing data for the Image Calculator (see <a href="#Transferring data to the Image Calculator">7.7. Transferring data to the Image Calculator</a>).</p>

<a NAME="Adding images"><font color="#373737"><h4>7.1. Adding images</font></h4></a>
<p>You can only add a limited number of images, specifically 1 light, 2 dark, 2 bias, 2 flat and 1 saturated, since this is all that is needed for the various calculations. Usually you would just add 2 bias, 2 flat and 1 saturated when you want to calculate sensor data, 1 light and 2 dark when you want to extract data for the Image Calculator, or 1 light when you just want to find the field of view or measure an angular distance.</p>
<p>If you use a CCD, make sure to specify whether it's monochrome or color before you start adding images. When you add an image, the program will check the image metadata for information about the ISO (for DSLRs) and exposure time. These will be compared to the corresponding values for any already added images, and you will be notified if the values differ between the images if they shouldn't. For color cameras, you might also be which color of pixels you want to extract. Splitting the color filter array (CFA) into its component colors is necessary to ensure valid measurements of shot noise. If the CFA pattern of your camera is not detected, you will be asked to specify this as well.</p>

<a NAME="Selecting and removing images"><font color="#373737"><h4>7.2. Selecting and removing images</font></h4></a>
<p>You can select added images by left-clicking on their names in the "Files" list. The name of the selected image will get a blue background, and the image will be displayed to the right. Right-clicking on an image name will mark it for removal, and the background will get red (or green if the image is also selected). Right-clicking again on a red name will remove all the marked images.</p>

<a NAME="Adjusting image view"><font color="#373737"><h4>7.3. Adjusting image view</font></h4></a>
<p>By default, the added images are displayed in 1:1, so that one image pixel corresponds to one pixel on the computer screen. If you right-click in an image and select "Fit to window", the image will be resized so that the entire image is visible. Right-click and select "Show full image" (yes, this is confusing and will be changed in the next update) to revert the resizing. Note that some functions, like extracting image data, are not available while the image is fitted to the window.</p>

<a NAME="Pointer modes"><font color="#373737"><h4>7.4. Pointer modes</font></h4></a>
<p>By default, when you click and drag in an image, a selection box will appear. This is used for selecting regions for extracting data to the Image Calulator, or when you want to look at the statistics of a limited part of the image (see <a href="#Getting image statistics">7.6. Getting image statistics</a>). If the active frame is a light frame, the field of view of the selected region will be shown rather than of the entire frame. You can activate the selection mode by right-clicking in the image and choosing ""Select" mode".</p>
<p>There is also a measuring mode, which is only available for light frames. This makes it possible to drag a line between to points, and the angular distance between the two points will be displayed. Right-click in the image and choose ""Measure" mode" to activate it.</p>
<p>Finally there is the dragging mode, which allows you to click and drag in the image to move around instead of using the scrollbars. Activate it by right-clicking in the image and choosing ""Drag" mode".</p>

<a NAME="Histogram and screen stretch"><font color="#373737"><h4>7.5. Histogram and screen stretch</font></h4></a>
<p>Right-clicking in an image and choosing "Histogram" will bring up the histogram of the image with options for adjusting the screen stretch. When an image is loaded, the program applies a stretch that corresponds to clipping the black and white point and bringing the mean pixel value to 25% gray. You can adjust this stretch with the histogram tool. Moving the slider to the left and clicking "Stretch histogram" will increase the contrast of the image, while moving the slider to the right will decrease the contrast. The "Clip black point" button sets the lowest pixel value in the image to black, and the "Clip white point" button sets the highest pixel value to white. Clicking "Autostretch" will apply the same stretch as when the image is loaded. Finally you can set the histogram to it's unstretched state, so that the image will be displayed in the raw, linear state. Note that you must click "Apply changes" to apply the histogram changes to the displayed image.</p>

<a NAME="Getting image statistics"><font color="#373737"><h4>7.6. Getting image statistics</font></h4></a>
<p>You can bring up a window showing various statistics about the pixel values in the image by right-clicking and selecting "Show statistics". If you have selected a region in the image, the statistics will be computed for that region only. Otherwise they will be computed for the entire image.</p>

<a NAME="Transferring data to the Image Calculator"><font color="#373737"><h4>7.7. Transferring data to the Image Calculator</font></h4></a>
<p>The Image Analyser tool allows you to extract from your light and dark frames all the information required by the Image Calculator. Here is how to do it:</p>
<p><b>Background and target data:</b></p>
<ol>
<p><li>&nbsp;Add the light frame you want to use in the Image Analyser.</li></p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Left-click and drag to draw a selection box over a background part of the image. The mouse pointer needs to be in the "Select" mode. (Change mode by right-clicking in the image and choosing the mode in the menu.)</li></p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Make the box as large as you can without including any stars. If there are very many stars, make sure it contains as few as possible without being too small.</li></p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Right-click anywhere in the image and select "Transfer data to Image Calculator". When asked which image region you have selected, choose "Background". The data from the selected region has now been copied to the input boxes of the Image Calculator.</li></p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Next, you need to draw a new selection box over a small region of the target. This will be the part of the target that the calculated SNR and target signal value will apply to.</li></p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Right-click in the image again and select "Transfer data to Image Calculator". This time choose "Target" in the window that pops up. The target level has now been copied to the corresponding input box in the Image Calculator.</li></p>
</ol>
<p><b>Dark frame data:</b></p>
<p>You have the option to use either one or two dark frames. If you use two, one of them can be subtracted from the other to remove static features like hot pixels. This will be done automatically for DSLR cameras to get better noise measurements.</p>
<ol>
<p><li>&nbsp;If you use a DSLR and only one dark frame, you should draw a selection box over a part of the image containing few hot pixels. Otherwise you shouldn't draw a selection box.</li></p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Right-click anywhere in the image and select "Transfer data to Image Calculator". The data from the dark frame has now been copied to the corresponding input boxes in the Image Calculator.</li></p>
</ol>

<a NAME="Calculating sensor data"><font color="#373737"><h4>7.8. Calculating sensor data</font></h4></a>
<ul>
<li><p>If you use a DSLR, decide which ISO value you want the data calculated for. Use this ISO for all test images. Make sure the camera is set to save the images in RAW format.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use a CCD, keep settings like binning and read rate the same for all test images.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the following test images with your camera:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two bias frames: The sensor should be covered and the exposure time should be as short as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Two flat frames: Image an evenly illuminated white surface. The histogram peak should be about half the way to the right, and the exposure time shouldn't exceed a few seconds unless the camera is cooled.</p></li>
<li><p>One saturated frame: Image something bright, and make sure some part of the image contains completely saturated pixels.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Start APLab and add the frames you just captured in the Image Analyser tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the "Compute sensor data" button, and the calculated values will be displayed. You can now save this information to use with the other tools.</p></li>
</ul>

<br>
<a NAME="The Image Calculator"><font color="#373737"><h3>8. The Image Calculator</font></h3></a>
<p>The Image Calculator uses data from a light frame (and optionally 1 or 2 dark frames), to compute a range of values related to signal and noise. Information about the active camera and optics is displayed as well. Details about the quantities expected by the various input boxes is provided in their respective tooltips. It is recommended that you aquire the noise and level values for the input boxes with the Image Analyser, as described is the tutorial linked to above. Note that input to the "Target level" box is not required to perform calulations. Omitting it will exclude target signal and SNR from the calculations.</p>

<br>
<a NAME="The Image Simulator"><font color="#373737"><h3>9. The Image Simulator</font></h3></a>
<p>The Image Simulator works similarly to the Image Calculator, but uses explicit dark current, skyglow and target signal values rather than pixel values. This tool is not intended for finding information about your actual image, but rather for experimenting with different values for the imaging parameters. You could for instance load calculated data from the Image Calculator, and then see what would happen if you had used a different ISO setting or exposure time, or if you stacked multiple frames. To help with visualizing the results, a synthetic image can be generated based on the imaging parameters and sensor data. This image will have similar signal and noise characteristics as a real image capured with the same parameters and conditions. Click the "Simulate image" button, and the synthetic image will show up in a new window. The image is linear by default (and thus corresponds to what the raw image would look like), but you can show a stretched version of the image by checking the "Stretch:" box.</p>

<br>
<a NAME="The Plotting Tool"><font color="#373737"><h3>10. The Plotting Tool</font></h3></a>
<p>The Plotting Tool has essentially the same purpose as the Image Simulator, namely visualizing the effect of changing certain parameters, but it does so with graphs rather than an image. Choose the plot you want from the list, input the required data (or transfer it from another tool), and click "Draw graph". I plan to provide more information on the subject of interpreting the graphs later on. Steve King has written a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.astronomyforum.net/astrophotography-image-processing-forum/204348-using-astrophotography-lab-determine-proper-exposure-time.html">nice tutorial</a> on determining the optimal exposure time using one of the plots.</p>

<br>
<a NAME="Reliability of the results"><font color="#373737"><h3>11. Reliability of the results</font></h3></a>
<p>The calculations of sensor data rely on accurate measurements of photon noise in a flat frame. The noise measurements can be affected if the flat frame is not uniform. To prevent this, the program asks for two flat frames, and subtracts one from the other to remove any features in the image.</p>
<p>If for some reason the two images are not equal (maybe a dust spot moved after the first frame was captured), then the subtracted image will not be uniform and the noise measurement will be affected. Keep this in mind when capturing the flat frames.</p>
<p>The results given by the Image Calculator are only as accurate as the data it uses for the calculations. While the data included in the default camera and telescope profiles shouldn't be too far off the correct values, I cannot vouch for its accuracy.</p>
<p>Most of the default DSLR data is not directly measured, but derived from other measurements performed by DxO for their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dxomark.com/">DxOMark site</a>. The CCD data is collected from various manufacturer sites and from other people posting their measurements. On top of this, I have had to make certain assumptions about the black and white levels, simply because there isn't enough data available.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I definitely recommend that you use the Image Analyser to perform your own measurements on your camera. Capturing the test frames is simple, and you hardly have to leave your chair.</p>
<p>When it comes to DSLRs, there is also the matter of raw frame "cooking". For many (if not all) models, additional processing is being done to the images before they are saved. For at least some Canon models, the images are darkened and the contrast is decreased for long exposure times (as described in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stark-labs.com/craig/resources/Articles-&-Reviews/CanonLinearity.pdf">this article</a> by Craig Stark).</p>
<p>APLab does <i>not</i> try to compensate for this kind of in-camera processing, because of insufficient knowledge of what is being done to the images. But by using measurements of noise rather than intensity in certain circumstances, the calculations are less sensitive to effects like long exposure darkening.</p>

<a NAME="Troubleshooting"><font color="#373737"><h3>13. Troubleshooting</font></h3></a>
<p>If you encounter an issue with the program, here is the standard procedure:</p>
<p><b>- Did you get an error message in the program?</b></p>
<p>If yes:</p>
<p>The message has been stored in the file "errorlog.txt" in the same directory as the program. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a>, describe the issue and provide the error log.</p>
<br>
<p>If no:</p>
<p>Go to the download site for your version of the program and download "aplab-vx.x.x-win-debug.zip". Install it like you did with the regular version. The debug versions differ from the regular versions in a single aspect, namely that they run with the windows terminal visible in the background. Any errors that are not caught by the logging function of the program might be displayed in the windows terminal. Run the debug version and try to replicate the error.</p>
<p><b>- Did you get an error message in the windows terminal?</b></p>
<p>If yes: </p>
<p><a href="contact.html">Contact me</a>, describe the issue and provide the error message.</p>
<p>If no:</p>
<p><a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> about the issue anyway.</p>

{"name":"Astrophotography Lab","tagline":"A program for experimenting with signal and noise in astrophotography.","body":"### Overview\r\nThe goal of Astrophotography Lab is to provide insight into the way camera settings and imaging conditions affect the signal and noise in your astronomical images.\r\n\r\nThe program consists of 4 main tools:\r\n\r\n1. An analyzer tool that can be used to extract information from your raw images, and calculate sensor characteristics like gain and read noise.\r\n\r\n2. A calculator that uses information from your image to calculate useful values like signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range.\r\n\r\n2. A simulator tool that creates a synthetic image based on imaging parameters provided by the user.\r\n\r\n3. A plotting tool that gives a graphical representation of how various imaging parameters affect the image quality.\r\n\r\nThe tools are connected, allowing you to transfer information between them, and easily go all the way from measuring your camera's sensor to finding the optimal settings for your next imaging session.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Automatic calculation of the sensor characteristics of you camera\r\n- Calculation of SNR, skyglow etc. by selecting areas of an image\r\n- Included sensor data for a wide range of CCD and DSLR cameras\r\n- Tooltips explaining the various imaging parameters and calculated values\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n[Latest version for Windows](https://github.com/oaltais/aplab/releases)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
